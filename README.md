## Introduction

This repository is where I document my NLP learning journey.   
It contains theory notes, practical code examples useful resources.


## 01-Text Preprocessing

Learn how to clean and prepare text for NLP.  
Includes 
- removing stop words lowercasing, tokenizing, and more.

## 02-Embeddings
 
Understand how to represent words as numbers (vectors) so machines can understand them.  
Includes:

- **Label & One Hot Encoder**
  
- **Bag Of Words**
  
- **TF-IDF**
  
- **Word2Vec**
   - **CBOW**
   - **Skip Gram**
     - **Negative Sampling**
       
- **Fast Text**


## 03-Models  
Explore different models used in NLP.
Includes:

- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**  

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  

- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**  

- **Transformers**
